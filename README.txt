ResNet50 & VGG19 Models, Computer Vision Tasks with PyQt5 Interface

📢 Project Introduction
This repository contains a comprehensive suite of computer vision tools integrated into a user-friendly PyQt5 interface. It includes various modules such as:

ResNet50 for binary classification
VGG19 for numeric classification trained on the MNIST dataset
PCA for image reconstruction
Optical Flow Analysis
Background Subtraction for video processing
These tools are designed to demonstrate advanced computer vision techniques and facilitate their understanding through practical application.

🚀 Getting Started
To run the project, execute the main.py file. This will launch the PyQt5 interface, as shown in the provided screenshots. Through this interface, you can interact with the various functionalities of the project.

🔍 Testing the Functionalities
Background Subtraction and Optical Flow: Load the videos from their respective folders within the Datasets directory to test these features.
PCA Dimension Reduction: Load images for PCA analysis from the corresponding folders in the Datasets directory, or use any other images you wish to test.
Binary Classification with ResNet50 (Dog and Cat): Similar to PCA, load the necessary images from the Datasets folder designed for this task.
Numeric Classification with VGG19: Enter a digit between 0 and 9 in the black screen on the interface and press the 'Predict' button. To test another number, click the 'Reset' button.
📊 Additional Features
Model Structures and Training Graphs: Use the provided buttons in the interface to view the structures of the VGG19 and ResNet50 models and their training graphs.
Note: The model should be trained by the user.
